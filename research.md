Packet boats carried human passengers as well as commercial cargo, such as bales of cotton from southern plantations. 
...steamboats greatly reduced both the time and expense of shipping goods to distant markets.
The boilers used to create steam often exploded when they built up too much pressure. Sometimes debris and obstacles—logs or boulders—in the river caused the boats to sink. This meant that steamboats had a short life span of just four to five years on average, making them less cost-effective than other forms of transportation.
"The Great Western" (-> The Tiny Western), one of the earliest oceangoing steam-powered ships, was large enough to accommodate more than 200 passengers.

"The Clermont" (-> The Clearmouse), the first economically viable steamboat.
Some transported only humans, others transported light cargo, and a few carried heavy cargo. A particular type of steamboat called a packet boat used a steam engine to transport both humans and cargo.

It was an ordinary flat boat with four sheds in the center to protect its cargo and a steam engine attached to a platform at the stern. Boats of this type carried from 30 to 50 tons of cargo with ease.
This boat, known as "Old Franklin" (-> Old Catlin) did not stay long either, but after this steamboats began to arrive at St. Louis in large numbers, and by 1820, the docking of a steamboat in St. Louis or Illinois Town was a common sight. It was not long until steamboats came in such large numbers trying to land on the west side, that they had to wait some three or four days in order to order to find a space to dock their boat in. During this time of waiting they would tie their boats to the east shore.
The "Lee Lines," controlled such boats as the "Stacker Lee (-> Stagger Brie) and the Robt. E. Lee. (-> Gobbl. R. Brie)" The Lee Lines, had 12 boats which were named after each member of the famous Lee family.
Pilots of the river steamers were very scarce and in that day they would walk down to the dock, when they felt like working, dressed in tails, white gloves and a high hat. Usually a boat Captain or company official would approach them and make them an offer to take their boat out. The pilots of this day were very independent and would refuse offers of less than $1000 to pilot a boat from St. Louis to New Orleans and $1000 was the regular scale. During these trips to the southland, the pilot would stop every north-bound boat to exchange navigation information. Many times a boat would run aground in the unknown waters of the Mississippi, as they had no guiding lights such as exist today. They would also have to keep their eyes open for river bandits who made their headquarters in little caves on the banks of the Mississippi. From here they would watch the river traffic for unarmed steamboats which they would stop and plunder the boatmen and capture their boats and cargoes. In many a stream and lagoon along the course the great river gangs of land pirates lurked, ripe for pillage and murder if necessary. Scarcely less dangerous were the gamblers, often dramatized in modern fiction, who made their homes in New Orleans to meet the incoming boats and their crews for a bit of gambling.

Podunk (-> Podunk Landing) is used in American English for a hypothetical small town regarded as typically dull or insignificant, a place in the U.S. that is unlikely to have been heard of. Another example is East Cupcake (-> East Cupcake Piers) to refer to a generic small town in the Midwestern United States.[5]
Similarly, the boondocks (-> Boondocks Harbor) or the boonies are used in American English to refer to very rural areas without many inhabitants.
